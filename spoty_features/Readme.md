# Spotify Features

## Overview
This is a project to do some cleaning and visualization of Spotify dataset

The dataset I will be using in this class project is "SpotifyFeatures.csv" I found it in Kaggle. After reading a lot of similar datasets, this one had similar information to the idea I want to implement in the future.

This dataset contains information about music tracks and characteristics that can describe features of the music, for example Basic track metadata (title, artist name, genre, track id) Popularity Music features (acousticness, danceability, energy, 
instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speech, valence) 
The explanation of every measure: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/

## Objectives
We want to understand user behaviors of this content consumption
- The type of content they consume
- Identify trends (continuous, seasonal)
- Identify the relationship between the different types of content
- Identify any behavior using our sites or platforms 
All this information will help us improve how we display our content, identify the correct funnel to acquire more subscribers, make more and better recommendations and be more assertive with each of our user targets.
That will increase our user database, engagement, and loyalty to our Brand. In this dataset, even when it is music related, the metadata used is similar to the one we have available for our content.
