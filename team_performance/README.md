This is a project used to do a quick analysis of a team of Engineers performance during a specific period of time.

We used data from Jira, basically we extracted a few key values 
- Sprint ID
- Ticket ID
- Ticket Description
- Story Points
- Status
- Engineer Name

I generate some plots to do a presentation to the upper management about team performance and individual effort of our engineering team. We did this analysis to show case the improvement of the team during the time.
